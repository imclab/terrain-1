Jaanga Terrain Thanks
=====================

None of this would be possible without [GitHub]( http://github.com) and its amazing pages facility.

Thank you Mr.doob for [Three.js]( http://mrdoob.github.io ) 

Thank you [Khronos Group]( http://www.khronos.org/ ) for [WebGL]( http://www.khronos.org/webgl/ )

Jaume Sánchez and his "[Blocky Earth](http://www.clicktorelease.com/code/blocky_earth/)" for giving me the idea that elevations are obtainable and you can do reverse Mercator projections.

And also to Bjørn Sandvik and his tutorial at [Textural terrains with three.js](http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2013/10/textural-terrains-with-threejs.html).

And to [meetar]( http://edgeca.se/journey-to-the-center-of-web3d/ ).

In paricular, Danni's post on the [Canvas tag and Three.js]( http://danni-three.blogspot.com/2013/09/threejs-heightmaps.html ) really helped.

See also and in particular [FGx on GitHub]( http://fgx.github.io ) which has been the cause and the impetus for this work - as well as the links on the Technics page.

Thank you [Open Street Map]( http://openstreetmap.org/copyright )

In preparing this data much use has been made of [GDAL]( http://gdal.org ) and [Image Magick]( http://imagemagick.org ). Thank you for the useful tools.

The previusly used source for the height maps for levels 0 to 4 is [CleanTOPO2]( http://www.shadedrelief.com/cleantopo2/index.html ).

And without Jonathan de Ferranti's [data]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/ ) the world would stll be flat...
