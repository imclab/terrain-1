Jaanga Terrain Contents
=======================

Methods, tools, data and demos to create lively 3D cartography - faster and more easily than ever before 

It's all more data than can fit in a single GitHub repository. 
The following is an annotated table of contents of what is in each repository:


## Jaanga Terrain
Repository: [Terrain]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain/ )

* Overviews, main wiki and primary issues page are all maintained in this repository
* Various documents provide descriptions of methodology and tools for fast easy access to elevation data for zoom levels 8 to 18
* Also holds the heightmaps with elevation data for Tile Map Service (TMS) zoom levels 0-7, 16K PNG files with 165 MB of files
* Data sourced from Jonathan de Ferranti's [Viewfinder Panoramas ~ 15 second data set ]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org15.htm )

## Jaanga Terrain DE15
Repository: [Terrain DE15]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-de15/ )

* Data sourced from Jonathan de Ferranti's [Viewfinder Panoramas ~ 15 second data set ]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org15.htm )
* Data supplied as PNG files organized in the Tile Map Service (TMS) 'hierarchical bins' manner;
* About one data point for every 500 meters
* Data set covers the entire globe
* Approximately 836 MB of data in 128 folders of 128 files each or 16,384 PNG files


## Jaanga Terrain DE3

Repository: [Terrain DE3 32-63]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-de3-32-63 )  
Repository: [Terrain DE3 64-95]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-de3-64-95 )  
Repository: [Terrain DE3 96-127]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-de3-96-127 )  

* Data sourced from Jonathan de Ferranti's [Viewfinder Panoramas ~ 3 second data set]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org3.htm )
* Data supplied as PNG files organized in the Tile Map Service (TMS) 'hierarchical bins' manner;
* About one data point for every 90 meters
* Approximately 2.85 GB of terrain data in 128 folders of 128 files each or 16,384 PNG files
* Files distributed via four repositories to comply with the GitHub request of one gigabyte maximum per repository


## Jaanga Terrain Viewer
Repository: [Terrain Viewer]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-viewer )

_A good place to start - especially if you just want to see the data..._

* A variety of tools, apps, demos and tips
* All work in your browser  - no plugin required
* Runs files locally or sourced from a static file server - such as [GitHub Pages]( http://pages.github.com/ )
* Supports real-time zoom, pan and rotate
* Toggle between two types of camera controllers: first person or trackball
* Easy to build your own place lists
* Obtain a permalink with location, zoom and scale using window.location.hash. Source code page has sample links
* Support for large user-defined gazette
* Toggle 3D placards that show place names
* Supports many 2D map overlays
* Generic 3D library - can be used with other apps and libraries
* FOSS, built with less than 500 lines of code
* Very small file size ~ you can easily open up and start hacking
* Fast enough to be usable

## Jaanga Terrain Plus

Repository: [Terrain Plus]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-plus )

* Gazetteers used by the viewers
* Heightmaps used in early versions
